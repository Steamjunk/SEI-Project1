## Moving Mummies!
The Pharaoh has decreed that the great pyramids of his ancestors be moved so that they do not block his view of the sun at the palace. It sounds mad to move an entire pyramid, but the word of the Pharaoh is law! So you'd better get started...

1. Only one pyramid piece can be moved at a time.
1. A pyramid piece can be moved to any open spot or on top of another piece.
1. No larger pyramid piece may be stacked on top of a smaller piece
1. Move the entire pyramid to its final resting place before sundown or face the curse of the mummy!

After the first move a timer starts. The timer is a framed by a sun above the pyramid. If the time is up and the player has not completed the pyramid the game is over and they are doomed to suffer the mummy's curse. 

There is a reset button to begin the game again.

The difficulty can be modified by the player before the game by selecting the number of pyramid levels.

### Flex Goals:

If a player completes the game with a top 5 fastest time for that difficulty, they will be immortalized on the plaque. Requires input from the user for the name. These scores will be 

Add animations to the moving pyramid pieces and to the sun timer in the sky. Create a mummy curse game over screen. Nicer pixel art.
